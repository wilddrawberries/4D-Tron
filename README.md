# 4D-Tron
4D Tron (NPC or PC)

Allows you to visualize both 3D and 4D in a 2D space.

When the tron characters enter the *THIRD DIMENSION* they become smaller and darker.

When the Tron characters enter the *FOURTH DIMENSION* they gain/lose sides depending how far they go. 

    -A circle with infinite sides is the closest.

    -A triangle with three sides is the furthest.
